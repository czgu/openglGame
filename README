## Compilation
- Steps (for linux only, no sound) // See for linux & mac part for how to compile on mac
    - In the main directory, issue "premake4 gmake", and "make"
    - "cd Game", issue "premake4 gmake", followed by "make"
    - Start the game with "./Game"

    The steps above is only for linux and will have no sound effect.
    Here is how to get sound working.

    For linux & mac:
        - install SDL2 and SDL2_mixer. Here are the urls (download source code):
            - https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php       // Download version 2.05
            - https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/    // Download version 2.01
            - for each source dir, run "./configure && make && make install"
        - for MAC, you are done, see above on how to make the game.
        - for Linux user, go to (Game dir)/Game/premake4.lua
            - remove "-DNOSOUND" from linux buildOptions
            - add "SDL2", "SDL2_mixer" to linkedLibs
            - now go through the steps above to make the game.

- The computer I used to run in lab is GL07

## Manual
    - Here are all the controls: W,A,S,D. move forward, left, right, and backward
    - Left click to destroy a block that is right infront of you
    - For camera there are two modes, which are togglable at the menu on top left:
        - third person (default):
            - the camera point towards the player
            - the horizontal movement of left mouse drag changes yaw
            - the vertical movement of left mouse drag changes pitch
            - use mouse scroll to change the distance of the camera to the player
            - the player's facing changes along with camera
        - first person:
            - left mouse drag up to look up, left mouse drag down to look down, same for left and right
            - for left and right, you can drag 360 degrees, but for up and down it is clipped at +- 60 degrees
    - Here are the usage of controls on the menu
        - Time slider: change the time of the day which is loops from [0, 1440] indefinitely.
            - 0 represents 6am in the morning, 375 is noon, 750 is sunset, 1125 is midnight
        - First person checkbox: toggle camera between first person/third person
        - Enable particles checkbox: if toggled, will randomly emit particles in all directions from the player
        - msaa checkbox: turn on multisample anti-aliasing

## Objectives
- Implement randomized terrain generation using perlin noise.
- Add water in the game, with graphics effects such as waves and reflection.
- Implement anti-aliasing using FXAA.
- Add texture mapping to the environments and characters.
- Add sound to the game such as sound effects and background music.
- Add keyframed character animations for attacking and walking.
- Implement particle effects when the player cast fireballs at the enemy.
- Simulate day-night cycle with phong shading.
- Implement shadow using shadow mapping technique and make sure they are affected by the time of day.
- Simulate tall grass blades through the use of geometry shader.
